-------KIRKCALDY ICE HOCKEY CLUB Website---------

This project meets the requirements for a website for Kirkcaldy Ice Hockey Club. This will display several details about the club, recent 
results and fixtures, team details and honours, a who's who in the committee, a facebook timeline feed to show recent activity, some in game
videos from different games and a selection of related links.

This will also provide users the ability to contact the ice hockey club and committee members as well as allowing links to social media content. 
Downloadable content for the clubs code of conduct will be included.

The project employs the Bootstrap framework v3.3.7, Font Awesome to showcase the same font used in the monthly magazine the club produces and a
bootstrap javascript library to run the carousel on the home page.

Using HTML5 and CSS3.


--------Used Content--------

Bootstrap js on the home page to skip through the teams and general details.
