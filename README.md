-------KIRKCALDY ICE HOCKEY CLUB Website---------

This project meets the requirements for a website for Kirkcaldy Ice Hockey Club. This will display several details about the club, recent 
results and fixtures, team details and honours, a who's who in the committee, a facebook timeline feed to show recent activity, some in game
videos from different games and a selection of related links.

This will also provide users the ability to contact the ice hockey club and committee members as well as allowing links to social media content. 
Downloadable content for the clubs code of conduct will be included.

The project employs the Bootstrap framework v3.3.7, Font Awesome to showcase the same font used in the monthly magazine the club produces.

Using HTML5 and CSS3.


--------Used Content--------

Front page xfade between pictures - I changed this to use the photos I have created and to decrease the length of time between picture fade in and out.

Modal used to showcase each of the teams and the honours they have acquired over recent seasons - this was changed to show a percentage of the screen
on display rather than a specific width.
